# Mail Sendee Autocomplete
A World of Warcraft Vanilla 1.12 addon

In the default Blizzard UI, when sending mail the sendee's name will attempt to auto complete, first using names for your friend's list, then from your guild list.
**Mail Sendee Autocomplete** extends that function to first attempt to send to your known alts, and then the players that you have previously sent mail to. Before checking your friend's list and guild list.

Additionally, if you have [SuperWoW](https://github.com/balakethelock/SuperWoW) installed, the list of known alts and players that you have previously sent mail to will be saved and loaded between **ALL** of your accounts.

## ToDo

Add a way to:

* List saved names
* Add a saved name
* Remove a saved name
